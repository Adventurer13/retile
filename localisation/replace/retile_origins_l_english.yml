# Immortal Emperor Opening
retile_origin.1.name:0 "Threat to the Immortal Throne"
retile_origin.1.desc:0 "There is not a [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] alive who remembers a time before [Leader.GetName]. There is not a [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] alive who shall live to see a time after [Leader.GetName]. Yet, just as the [Root.GetName] begins expanding its territories beyond [Root.GetHomeWorldName], a new threat has emerged from within. The secret of immortality has been stolen by one who claims to be an heir to the throne. Yet there can be no heir to the throne."
retile_origin.1.a:0 "I am the throne."

# Immortal Emperor Assassination Attempt
retile_origin.2.name:0 "Assassination Attempt"
retile_origin.2.desc:0 "[immortal_challenger.GetName] has made their first move in a predictable assassination attempt against their undying ruler. It would be a simple matter to destroy them, but they are kin, and I would have to live with that decision for eternity. I could convince [immortal_challenger.GetName] to remain as my eternal heir. This alliance, if achieved could make us both invincible. Alternatively, I could simply ignore [immortal_challenger.GetName], and show the people of the [Root.GetName] that there is nothing that is a threat to me, even if such a strategy does in fact put me at risk."
retile_origin.2.a:0 "Have [immortal_challenger.GetName] killed."
retile_origin.2.a.tooltip:0 "§R[immortal_challenger.GetName] will die.\nAnother will eventually take their place.§!"
retile_origin.2.b:0 "Convert [immortal_challenger.GetName] to my cause."
retile_origin.2.b.tooltip:0 "§R[immortal_challenger.GetName] may submit.§!"
retile_origin.2.c:0 "Ignore [immortal_challenger.GetName]."
retile_origin.2.c.tooltip:0 "§RThis is a foolish plan.§!"

# Challenger Killed
retile_origin.3.name:0 "[immortal_challenger.GetName] Destroyed"
retile_origin.3.desc:0 "A life is a simple thing to end, but living with having done so to a being that could have existed in perpetuity is no small act. The future of the [Root.GetName] will be shaped by this decision, just as it will forever shape [Leader.GetName]. The [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] will know their place, and it is unlikely that another will challenge their undying ruler for generations."
retile_origin.3.a:0 "Now we move forward unimpeded."

# Challenger Converted
retile_origin.4.name:0 "[immortal_challenger.GetName] Submits"
retile_origin.4.desc:0 "[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] waited in silence as their undying leader met with [immortal_challenger.GetName] to agree on the details of the indefinite position of an eternal heir. So long as [immortal_challenger.GetName] lived, they would sit beside [Leader.GetName]'s immortal throne. The cost of this agreement was that [immortal_challenger.GetName] could never rule, but must remain as the [Root.GetName]'s eternal heir. Only time will reveal if this means that the danger has passed."
retile_origin.4.a:0 "We move forward together."

# Challenger Ascends
retile_origin.5.name:0 "[Leader.GetName] is Dead"
retile_origin.5.desc:0 "The tyrannical rule of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]'s first immortal emperor has come to an end, and the [Root.GetName]'s second chapter now begins! From now on, immortality will not mean stagnation. A brighter future awaits the [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] if we open our hearts to it."
retile_origin.5.a:0 "A new day is upon us."
