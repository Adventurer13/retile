retile_colony.1.name:0 "Mysterious Outbreak on [Root.GetName]"
retile_colony.1.desc:0 "Reports are coming in of a rapidly spreading disease on [Root.GetName] unlike any disease encountered before. So far the new disease has not caused any fatalities, but the effects of it are nonetheless debilitating. Local authorities are scrambling to minimize its spread."
retile_colony.1.a:0 "We will study this infection."
retile_colony.2.name:0 "Infection Spreads on [Root.GetName]"
retile_colony.2.desc:0 "More fall victim to the outbreak on [Root.GetName]. This will continue to get worse until a cure is developed."
retile_colony.2.a:0 "We must hurry."
retile_colony.3.name:0 "Coronal Infection"
retile_colony.3.desc:0 "Research into the mysterious disease on [Root.GetName] has produced surpising and fascinating results. The infection starts in the vision centers of the victim and seems to be transmitted through the electromagnetic spectrum. Scans have revealed unusual electromagnetic signals eminating from the coronal region of the nearby sun. Perhaps understanding the origin of these signals can help us understand how the disease works."
retile_colony.3.a:0 "We must decrypt these signals."
retile_colony.4.name:0 "Alien Technology discovered around [From.GetName]"
retile_colony.4.desc:0 "The unusual electromagnetic signals were being sent by alien ships in low orbit around the star, hidden within its corona. They appear to be using the star's surface as an energy source, but it is unknown what their function is. The ships are too close to the sun's surface to board, making investigation as to their true purpose difficult, but a gentle nudge could easily push them into the star instead."
retile_colony.4.a:0 "Destroy the ships and stop the signals entirely."
retile_colony.4.b:0 "Attempt to pull the ships into a higher orbit for boarding."
retile_colony.5.name:0 "Fatalities on [Root.GetName] to Viral Infection"
retile_colony.5.desc:0 "Symptoms from the viral infection very suddenly turned lethal, resulting into the deaths of the infected population. There was nothing that could be done."
retile_colony.5.a:0 "Tragic."
retile_colony.6.name:0 "Alien Ships Boarded"
retile_colony.6.desc:0 "Inside the ancient ships were records of a long extinct race that seems to have left behind no trace of their existence except for these ships, which may have simply been forgotten due to their hidden location. The purpose of the ships isn't fully understood, but they seem to have been encoding visible light into some form of data transmission meant to interact with biological organisms. This has resulted, through cosmic accident, in the creation of a biological virus that now afflicts the current residents of [Root.GetName]. It may be possible to adjust the light emmited by these ships to reverse the effects."
retile_colony.6.a:0 "Attempt to engineer a cure."
retile_colony.6.b:0 "It's too dangerous. Send these ships into the sun."
retile_colony.7.name:0 "Alien Signal Modified"
retile_colony.7.desc:0 "The signal has been adjusted to undo the damage it has caused to the inhabitants of [Root.GetName]. All that is left is to reposition the ships into the sun's corona so they can reactivate."
retile_colony.7.a:0 "Let us hope this works."
retile_colony.8.name:0 "Coronal Virus Victims on [Root.GetName] Recover"
retile_colony.8.desc:0 "Against all odds, victims of the viral infection on [Root.GetName] have made a full recovery and everyone breathes a sigh of relief."
