 crime.1.desc:0 "Discontent and poverty are spreading at an alarming rate on §H[Root.GetName]§!. This sorry state of affairs is being exploited by local crime organizations, who find themselves awash with both easy marks and desperate recruits.\n\nAs a temporary solution, we could increase government services on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. It will not be cheap, but would provide additional time to seek a more permanent solution, such as improving the living standards of the affected population groups.\n\nWe could also do nothing, but this would likely result in the formation of a significant criminal underworld on [Root.GetName]."

It will not be cheap, but this would give us additional time to create more jobs.\n\nWe could also do nothing, but this would likely result in the formation of significant deviant drone communities on [Root.GetName]."

This will drastically increase their maintenance costs, but it would give us time to create more jobs.\n\nWe could also do nothing, but this would likely result in the continued proliferation of corrupted drone networks on [Root.GetName]."
