 creature_gasgiant_category:0 "Gas Giant Ecosystem"
 creature_gasgiant_category_desc:0 "An ecosystem of complex lifeforms exists beneath the clouds of this jovian world."
 call_me_joe_poi:1 "Mysterious Psionic Jovian Study"
 call_me_joe_poi_desc:1 "We should study the mysterious organisms living on the surface of [call_me_joe_planet.GetName]"
 retile_anomaly.1.name:0 "Psionic Creatures in the Gas"
 retile_anomaly.1.desc:0 "Many unusual organisms flourish on surface deep within [From.GetName]'s thick atmosphere. These creatures appear to communicate using some form of psionic transmission. We could tap into their psionic frequency and attempt to observe them directly, or just study the signals from orbit."
 retile_anomaly.1.a:0 "Attempt to connect to the creatures."
 retile_anomaly.1.b:0 "That's too dangerous. Study them from orbit."
 call_me_joe_chain_title:0 "Call Me Jove"
 call_me_joe_chain_desc:0 "Mysterious jovian creatures with latent psionic abilities inhabit the reclusive surface of a strange gas giant."
 CALL_ME_JOE_1_PROJECT:0 "Establish Psionic Link"
 CALL_ME_JOE_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Create a direct link to the mysterious psionic jovian organisms to observe their behavior."
 CALL_ME_JOE_2_PROJECT:0 "Gather Jovian Organism Data"
 CALL_ME_JOE_2_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Collect as much data as possible on the mysterious psionic jovian organisms from above the thick atmosphere."
 retile_anomaly.2.name:0 "Jovian Connection Established"
 retile_anomaly.2.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] has been connected to one of the jovian creatures, which has been named Jove. The preliminary findings are groundbreaking, but a bleeding of Jove's personality and psionic capacity has been observed in [Root.GetLeaderName]. Concerns about the safety of this research are being raised by the crew of the [Root.GetName]."
 retile_anomaly.2.a:0 "Continue with the research."
 retile_anomaly.2.b:0 "Stop this immediately."
 retile_anomaly.3.name:0 "Orbital Scans Complete"
 retile_anomaly.3.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] has completed its orbital scans of the mysterious psionic creatures living beneath [From.GetName]'s atmosphere. We can continue to observe shifts in their environment if we desire."
 retile_anomaly.3.a:0 "Good work."
 CALL_ME_JOE_3_PROJECT:0 "Inhabit Jove"
 CALL_ME_JOE_3_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Use Jove as an avatar through which to continue researching the psionic jovians."
 retile_anomaly.4.name:0 "Call Me Jove"
 retile_anomaly.4.desc:0 "The more the organism known as Jove became [Root.GetLeaderName], the more [Root.GetLeaderName] has became Jove. The crew of the [Root.GetName] is currently attempting to restore the researcher's original mind. They are requesting permission to disconnect [Root.GetLeaderName] from the jovian organism."
 retile_anomaly.4.a:0 "Disconnecting them sounds dangerous. Request denied."
 retile_anomaly.4.b:0 "Disconnect them immediately and recover our researcher!"
 CALL_ME_JOE_4_PROJECT:0 "Reclaim Researcher's Mind"
 CALL_ME_JOE_4_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Without disconnecting the psionic link that binds them, we will attempt to recover the minds of both organisms and make them distinguishable from each other again."
 CALL_ME_JOE_5_PROJECT:0 "Reclaim Researcher's Mind"
 CALL_ME_JOE_5_PROJECT_DESC:0 "By severing the connection with Jove, we will attempt to reclaim the mind of our scientist from this experiment gone awry."
 retile_anomaly.5.name:0 "Jove has Departed"
 retile_anomaly.5.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] reports that they failed to restore the researcher, simply known as Jove, back to normality. It detected the intrusion and abandoned their original body. Jove is believed to be living on the surface of [call_me_joe_planet.GetName] in Jove's original body among the other psionic creatures of the planet. Though we have lost a valuable scientist, the collected data from the incident is believed to revolutionize what we know about the universe."
 retile_anomaly.5.a:0 "Hopefully it was worth this."
 retile_anomaly.6.name:0 "Jove has Recovered"
 retile_anomaly.6.desc:0 "The crew of the [Root.GetName] is happy to report that the researcher has fully integrated Jove into their personality and has for the most part returned to normal. Since the incident, it appears that the psionic frequencies emerging from the jovians on [call_me_joe_planet.GetName] have been disrupted and further experimentation is no longer possible. We will surely continue to benefit from Jove's unique knowledge and experiences."
 retile_anomaly.6.a:0 "This is good news."

 spiritual_calculator_category_desc:0 "An ancient machine that appears to have deep significance to a lost civilization lies broken."
 retile_anomaly.7.name:0 "Spiritual Calculations"
 retile_anomaly.7.desc:0 "Researchers have recovered the strange alien device that seems to have been performing calculations for what is suggested to be religious reasons."
 retile_anomaly.7.a:0 "Attempt to decipher the alien language."
 retile_anomaly.7.b:0 "Reactivate the device."
 NAMES_OF_GOD_1_PROJECT:0 "Translate Alien Calculations"
 NAMES_OF_GOD_1_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Attempt to understand what the mysterious calculations of this alien device are intended to do."
 NAMES_OF_GOD_2_PROJECT:0 "Activate Spiritual Calculator"
 NAMES_OF_GOD_2_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Reactivate the mysterious alien device and allow it to finish its calculations."
 retile_anomaly.8.name:0 "Nine Billion Names of God"
 retile_anomaly.8.desc:0 "Researchers were correct in identifying the religious nature of this calculating machine. It was constructed so that it might output what this ancient species believed to be all 9,000,000,000 names of their god. The process would have taken a machine of this construction roughly 15,000 years to complete its task, but it was rendered inoperable long before completion. With our current technology, we could finish the calculation in a far shorter timeframe if we wanted to."
 retile_anomaly.8.spiritualist:0 "This could lead to greater wisdom!"
 retile_anomaly.8.materialist:0 "Turn it on just to prove its foolishness!"
 retile_anomaly.8.a:0 "Maybe something will come of it."
 retile_anomaly.8.b:0 "This is a waste of time."
 retile_anomaly.9.name:0 "Calculations Restored"
 retile_anomaly.9.desc:0 "The calculator begins its calculations again, outputting something mysterious in an alien language. What appears to be a countdown is visible on the device, and if the hypothesis from scientists is correct, it'll be at least another 10,000 years before its calculations are done. Whatever sentient creatures were looking for, they have now passed the torch to us, and we will oversee the next phase in its long and slow process. Perhaps our descendents or whoever comes after us will learn from whatever it has to teach, or perhaps it will always just remain a curiosity."
 retile_anomaly.9.a:0 "It belongs in a museum."
 NAMES_OF_GOD_3_PROJECT:0 "Complete the Spiritual Calculation"
 NAMES_OF_GOD_3_PROJECT_DESC:0 "Develop algorithms to hasten the generation of the remaining of the 9 billion names of God."
 retile_anomaly.10.name:0 "Sacred Namelist Complete"
 retile_anomaly.10.desc:0 "An algorithm was created to calculate all nine billion names of the ancient alien god. A curious thing happened when the data was compiled. Though the names were in a dead language from an unknown species, the combined names formed sensible statements in languages we already understood. These statements appear to be a combination of already verified and previously untested facts about the fundamental nature of the universe. The implications of this have shaken the scientists involved and fundamentally altered our understanding of our place in the cosmos. Overhead, without any fuss, distant galaxies were going out."
 retile_anomaly.10.a:0 "An interesting outcome."
 retile_generate.7.name:0 "End of Time"
 retile_generate.7.desc:0 "Very slowy and very silently the distant galaxies of the night sky blinked out of existence. Over the eons the night sky has grown darker and emptier. Now, at last, our own galaxy is snuffed out. The names of God have been discovered and it is now time for the universe to end."
 retile_generate.7.a:0 "Finally."
