Files that need another look
	/common/diplomacy_economy/00_diplomacy_economy.txt -> 3 new entries added for relations and closed borders, at the bottom of the file.
	/common/megastructures/11_mega_shipyard.txt -> needs same treatment as other megas. (GEBNAR will do)
	/common/planet_modifiers/00_planet_modifiers.txt -> ours was missing "pm_extensive_moon_system" so I added it. Not sure if it was removed or is new in 2.6
	/common/decisions/02_special_decisions.txt -> new code gives an opinion bonus from FE if you consecrate their holy world
	/common/scripted_effects/primitives_scripted_effects -> Needs complete rewrite. (GEBNAR will do)
	/common/scripted_triggers/01_scripted_triggers_buildings_ai -> Adds a few new functions that probably need work (GEBNAR will do)
	/common/solar_system_initializers/marauder_initializers.txt -> change how marauder species are created. Added exclusion for plantoids. Probably needs more refinement.
	/common/solar_system_initializers/special_system_initializers.txt -> looks like a whole sol initializer was removed in 2.6. I culled it from our file as well...
	/common/trade_conversions/00_trade_conversions.txt -> Needs "trade league" conversions added, or trade league needs to be integrated in a different way...
