Files that need another look
	/common/diplomacy_economy/00_diplomacy_economy.txt -> 3 new entries added for relations and closed borders, at the bottom of the file.
	/common/megastructures/11_mega_shipyard.txt -> needs same treatment as other megas. (GEBNAR will do)
	/common/planet_modifiers/00_planet_modifiers.txt -> ours was missing "pm_extensive_moon_system" so I added it. Not sure if it was removed or is new in 2.6
	/common/decisions/02_special_decisions.txt -> new code gives an opinion bonus from FE if you consecrate their holy world
	/common/scripted_effects/primitives_scripted_effects -> Needs complete rewrite. (GEBNAR will do)
