	"imagine if you didn't see hyperlanes unless you saw both systems"

FIX COLONIZATION SO IT'S NOT BETTER THAN GROWING POPS... SOMEHOW?!?!?! maybe...
	- Fix tradition that adds colonist, to instead add building slot (and improve colonist).
	- planets can't be decolonized by resettling.
	- add "Abandon Planet" decision that just kills a colony, without any prerequisites or safeguards...
		- pops look for homes in their parent empire and anywhere with an acceptable refugees policy.
		- The *first* pop looks for other empires to go to, and if it doesn't find any, it's just destroyed.
